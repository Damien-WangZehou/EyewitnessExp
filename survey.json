Before you decide whether to participate, I would like you to understand why the research is being conducted and what it would involve for you. Please <a href=\"mailto:damien.wang@bristol.ac.uk\">email me</a> questions if anything is unclear.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>What is the purpose of the project?</h4>\n<p>This project aims to determine if Artificial Intelligence (Face Recognition System) can make a better lineup.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Why have I been invited to participate?</h4>\n<p>We are asking you to take part as we are looking to recruit a diverse sample of people, of any age, gender or ethnicity.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>\n<p>It is up to you to decide whether you wish to participate in the project. I will describe the study and you will go through this information sheet before deciding to participate. Please ask any questions you might have. If you agree to take part, you will have to consent. You are free to withdraw at any time, without giving a reason.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>What will happen to me if I take part and what will I have to do?</h4>\n<p>You will first watch a brief video (under 1 minute). You may be asked to play some games, like Tetris. Next you will view a police lineup. If you see the person from the video, you will pick that member. If you do not see the person from the video, you will not pick anyone. You will then rate your confidence. <strong>The experiment will take less than 10 minutes.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>What are the possible disadvantages and risks involved in taking part in the project?</h4>\n<p>There are no known risks in taking part in this experiment. In terms of data collection, no names will be collected, and you will only be identified by a number. We will be in full compliance of GDPR and the standards for data protection set out in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/secretary/data-protection/\" rel=\"noopener\">University of Bristol guidelines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h4>\n<p>This research is not designed to help individual participants personally, but the results may help the researchers learn more about eyewitness identification. We hope that, in the future, other people might benefit from this study through improved understanding of human behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Will my participation in this project be kept confidential?</h4>\n<p>The participation is <strong>anonymous</strong>, we do not know who the participants are. The data collected about you during the research will be kept strictly confidential. The data will be stored in secure servers. The data may be shared online on sites that are dedicated to hosting anonymised/anonymous data from research.</p>",

In this experiment, you saw a video of a mock crime and tried to pick the perpetrator out of a lineup and rated how confident you were. The time you use to make the decision was also recorded.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The higher an eyewitness\u2019s confidence in an identification is, the higher the accuracy tends to be. Also, the faster an eyewitness makes an identification, the higher the accuracy tends to be. Therefore, we\u2019ll see if the same holds true with our sample of people who took part.\n</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Usually, a police officer will assemble a lineup for eyewitnesses. Lineups include images of the police\u2019s suspect (who may be innocent or guilty) and several other \u201cfiller\u201d individuals. Fillers have impacts on memory performance and we are testing whether artificial intelligence, namely, the use of a Face Recognition System, for filler selection leads to higher accuracy in eyewitness identifications. This research could offer critical insights into the efficacy of integrating technology with traditional eyewitness identification procedures, potentially enhancing the reliability of such identifications in criminal justice processes.\n</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The results of this research are relevant to the criminal justice system where confidence and time to make decisions in an initial identification of the police suspect from a lineup are just now being considered by the police and courts (in the US, but not yet in the UK). There is much evidence that confidence and time to make decisions in the initial identification of a suspect is indicative of accuracy. \n</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions or would like to learn more about this research, then please contact <a href=\"mailto:damien.wang@bristol.ac.uk\">Damien Wang</a> . \n</p>\n\n<p><br></p>",
